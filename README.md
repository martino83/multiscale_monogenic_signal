This folder contains a MATLAB implementation of the multiscale monogenic 
optical flow algorithm described in:

M. Alessandrini, A. Basarab, H. Liebgott and O. Bernard, "Myocardial Motion Estimation from Medical Images Using the Monogenic Signal", accepted for
publication to IEEE Transactions on Image Processing.

The main file 'main_monogenic_signal' shows how to compute the monogenic 
signal and its features from a single image.

The main file 'main_compute_of_yosemite' runs the optical flow estimate on
the yosemite testing sequence.
